# H1 Weather Dashboard Server Side API

This assignment required the student to build a site that uses dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The user story required that the user be able to see the weather output for multiple cities to plan a trip accordingly.

This dashboard features a prompt that requires a user to enter a city name. Once the city name is entered the site dynamically populates a 5 day forecast for that city. When that city is typed in it is added to the search history. The user has the option to "clear history" and re-enter another city name for weather conditions.

The following variables are called from the 3rd party server API in Javascript:

1. City
2. Temperature
3. Humidity
4. Wind speed
5. UV Index

To complete this assignment I used css bootstrap script from the following sites to dynamically populate the pages with data:

1.  https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css
2.  https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.11.2/css/all.min.css

I also embedded a 3rd party server from Openweather One Call API and generated a unique key for weather forecasts. To do this I created a log in and was able to receive a unique key for this site. It took 2 days for the key to generate data from OpenWeather One Call API.

I programmed the functions to populate the page with data in javascript. This is also the language used to generate responses for the buttons.
